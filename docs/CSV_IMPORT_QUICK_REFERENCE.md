| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Import 5-10 rows first to test format
2. **Check headers**: Copy exact column names from spec
3. **Consistent names**: Use same spelling throughout CSV
4. **Use areas**: Create area list first for consistency
5. **Backup data**: Export JSON before large imports
6. **Review preview**: Check Step 3 table for obvious errors
7. **Use fuzzy matching**: Typos are auto-corrected
8. **Batch by type**: One import per type for cleaner audit trail
