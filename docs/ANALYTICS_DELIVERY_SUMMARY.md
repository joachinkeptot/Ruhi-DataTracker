## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Data Sources

```typescript
people[]              // Person records with dateAdded, homeVisits, etc.
activities[]          // Activity records with type, participants
```

### Calculations (All Real Data)

```typescript
// New people = filter by dateAdded within range
// Growth % = ((current - previous) / previous) * 100
// Engagements = sum of visits + conversations
// Learning = count of completed books with dates
```

### Architecture Pattern

```
Analytics (Main Component)
├─ TimePeriodSelector (UI for dates)
├─ MetricsCards (4 cards)
├─ Charts
│  ├─ LineChart (people)
│  ├─ BarChart (activities)
│  ├─ AreaChart (participation)
│  └─ BarChart (learning)
├─ HeatMap (visits by area)
├─ InsightsSection (auto-generated)
└─ ExportPDF (html2canvas + jsPDF)

All using:
- useState for UI state
- useMemo for calculations
- useApp() for data access
- Recharts for visualizations
```

## 📊 Sample Data Flow

```
User Selects "Last Month"
        ↓
Component calculates: 30 days back from today
        ↓
Filter people by: dateAdded within range
Filter homeVisits by: date within range
Filter conversations by: date within range
Filter learning by: completion date within range
        ↓
Calculate metrics:
- Total people: 1234
- New: 45 (↑15%)
- Activities: 89
- Home visits: 156
- Conversations: 89
- Learning: 57
        ↓
Create chart data:
- Weekly people additions
- Activity type breakdown
- Participation status
- Learning completions
        ↓
Generate heat map:
- Visits per area per week
        ↓
Identify insights:
- East area has low activity
- 3 people unconnected
- Growth trending up
        ↓
Render UI with all data
        ↓
User can export to PDF
```
